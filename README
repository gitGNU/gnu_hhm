About:

hhm is a program that currently makes ITS files. These are a kind of
archive format, like ZIP, TAR, CAB etc. They utilise Microsoft's LZX
compression to compress all the files in one big chunk. More info on
the ITSF format, as well as a decompressor and an LZX compression
library, is available from http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/.
In the future hhm will process HHP files & produce Compiled HTML Help
files (CHMs). These are just ITS files with some special files inside
them to implement the features of Microsoft's HTML Help program.

Other implementations:

Currently Microsoft's implementation exposed through an ITStorage interface
from itss.dll is the only known implementation other than hhm. Having said
that I suspect that KeyWorks Software has their own implementation that is
used in producing installers for their software and ITS files or else the
installer program that adds itss.dll to a system gives a different version
to Win2K than to Win95 or the behaviour of itss.dll differs from Win95 to
Win2K.

Dependencies:

hhm needs an LZX cruncher. I have used lzxcomp by Matthew T. Russotto,
which is available from http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/. If other
LZX crunchers exist it shouldn't be too hard to adapt hhm to use their API.

Building, usage & testing:

#You should have done the next 2 lines already
#wget http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/hhm/hhm-0.1.1.tar.gz
#tar zxvf hhm-0.1.1.tar.gz
wget http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/lzx_compress.tar.gz
tar zxvf lzx_compress.tar.gz &
wget http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/chmtools.tar.gz
tar zxvf chmtools.tar.gz
cd chmtools
make
cd ../lzx_compress
make
cd ../hhm
ln -s lzx_compress ../lzx_compress
./configure
make
mkdir foo-bar
cd foo-bar
echo '<html><body>
<p>This is a test file named index.html<br />
It is part of the ITSF file named foo-bar.its</p>
</body></html>' > index.html
cd ..
hhm foo-bar > /dev/null
../chmtools/chmdump foo-bar.its foo-bar-extracted &> /dev/null
diff -U foo-bar foo-bar-extracted > ../its-diff
mv foo-bar.its ..
cd ..
less ./its-diff
